I study the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of microbial communities. I have a Ph.D in Biology from Indiana University Bloomington where I was a member of the [Lennon Lab](https://microbes.sitehost.iu.edu/) and was a postdoctoral fellow in the [Garud Lab](https://garud.eeb.ucla.edu/). I am currently a fellow in the [Quantitative Ecology and Evolution Group](https://jacopogrilli.github.io/) at [The Abdus Salam Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)](https://www.ictp.it/about-ictp.aspx). While I was trained as a biologist, during my Ph.D. I became inspired by the ongoing physics-driven transformation of microbial ecology and made the deliberate choice to use the postdoc stage to build a statistical physicist's intuition and understanding of microbial communities. By applying principles from statistical physics, I believe that biologists can readily adopt a wholly quantitative framework that is capable of welding dynamic models of measurable quantities to high-throughput experiments.


My research can be coarse-grained into the following efforts:

* Identifying macroecological patterns in microbial communities.

* Characterizing microbial ecology and evolution in low-energy environments.

* Examining the macroecological dynamics of strain-level structure in the human gut microbiome.

**These interests are consolidated by a shared rule: by coupling experimental and observational data with intuitive mathematical models containing few, if any, free parameters, we can gain greater insight into biological systems.** At present, I primarily use computational and mathematical tools to perform my research, though I have considerable wet lab experience and have performed field research in temperate and tropical environments.

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, lifting, reading, film, and car repair.
